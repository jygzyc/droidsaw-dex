The `node == self.virtual_exit` guard at every entry point handles the sentinel. Every other BlockIdx must satisfy `node.0 < cfg.blocks.len()` by mint discipline; an out-of-range value here is an internal-invariant violation, NOT adversarial input. Panic-on-bug is the correct fail mode for invariant violation: `.get()` with empty fallback would mask wrong dominators silently. Panic-on-bug is intentional: see `ReversedCfg` doc-comment for rationale."
