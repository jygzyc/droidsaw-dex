//! DEX byte emitter — the inverse of `parser::DexFile::parse`.
//!
//! `emit_dex(dex)` serializes a parsed `DexFile` back to bytes such that
//! `parse(emit_dex(parse(bytes))) == parse(bytes)` at the IR level
//! (structural equivalence). Byte-identity is the deterministic-path
//! consequence of canonical IR ordering + symmetric emit — tracked as
//! an opt-in property tracked separately, not enforced by default.
//!
//! **Trust boundary.** The output retains the same trust level as its
//! input. Round-trip consistency proves emit is consistent with our
//! parser; it does not prove emit output is safe to hand to
//! ART / Dalvik. Downstream consumers must treat emit output as
//! adversarial-equivalent to its input DEX.
//!
//! **Canonical ordering (gauge-fix).** The DEX spec requires five id
//! pools to be lexicographically sorted: `string_ids`, `type_ids`,
//! `proto_ids`, `field_ids`, `method_ids`. The [`NonDecreasing`]
//! newtype makes this invariant structural: emit code can only obtain
//! a `NonDecreasing<T>` by calling [`NonDecreasing::from_sorted`],
//! which sorts on construction. The type system forbids an emit path
//! that skips or reorders after wrapping. Byte-identity becomes a
//! theorem of the sort function + emit symmetry, not a test result.
//!
//! Analogously, [`StrictlyAscending`] carries the stricter invariant
//! `inner[i] < inner[j]` for `i < j` and is used for `sparse-switch`
//! keys (spec §6 — VM does binary-search dispatch; duplicates would
//! be non-deterministic).
//!
//! **Emit domain ⊊ Parse domain.** The parser is defensive: it accepts
//! a wider set of byte sequences than emit can produce. Emit rejects
//! IR shapes that are structurally ill-formed even if parse-acceptable
//! (e.g., an `encoded_catch_handler` with zero typed catches and no
//! `catch_all_addr` — spec-representable byte-wise, but a handler with
//! no runtime effect). This asymmetry is by design:
//!
//! - `parse → IR` tolerates anomalies so analysis can proceed on
//!   adversarial input without panicking.
//! - `IR → emit` rejects the same anomalies so we never produce bytes
//!   that round-trip an ill-formed shape onward.
//!
//! Hand-built IR (test fixtures, synthesized transformations) must
//! satisfy emit's stricter invariants. Parser-produced IR already does
//! on the paths that matter (e.g., `parse_code_item` never emits
//! `CatchHandler { catches: [], catch_all_addr: None }`: `size_raw = 0`
//! sets `has_catch_all = true`).

/// content. A downstream lazy-reading debug-info consumer that
/// dereferences the stale offset runs the debug-info state-machine
/// over attacker-chosen bytes (DBG_START_LOCAL with attacker-indexed

/// captures the exact on-disk byte range of each debug_info_item,
/// walking the state machine through DBG_END_SEQUENCE. The emitter
/// writes those raw bytes into its own data section and rewrites
/// each `code_item.debug_info_off` to point into the EMITTER-
/// controlled, EMITTER-derived, EMITTER-deterministic output region.
/// Post-round-trip, the offset NEVER references attacker-crafted
/// foreign content (strings / code / class_data / etc.) — it
/// references bytes that are byte-copies of the original debug_info
